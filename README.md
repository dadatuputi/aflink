# Link Requests

You may submit a request for a link in one of two ways, both of which require a free Github account:

1. [Expert] Fork the repo, add your link to `src/links/links_other.json`, and create a pull request

2. Submit a link request by [filling out this Github issue form](https://github.com/dadatuputi/aflinks/issues/new?assignees=dadatuputi&labels=link+request&template=request_link.yaml&title=%5BLINK%5D%3A+)
